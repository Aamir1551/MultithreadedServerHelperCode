# MultiThreadedServerHelperCode 
Helper code for single threaded server for CS networking students

To use this as a guide, first read, Server.java, then client.java and ClientHandler.java

Once read. Then read OptimisedServer.java


To test this code:
1) First javac all the files
2) Use one terminal for server and set it up (java server) -- First check out server.java
3) Use one terminal for client 1
4) Use one terminal for client 2

After testing out server.java as your server, have a look at optimised server

Now see how it behaves with 2 clients
